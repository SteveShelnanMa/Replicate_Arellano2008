# Replicate_Arellano2008
Replicate the figure 2, 3, 4 of Arellano(AER, 2008) with python.

The replications may not be exactly the same as my debt set is chosen differently.

The file borrowed the updating algorithm from QuantEcon (https://quantecon.org), which is not how Arellano updated.
I acknowledge their priceless work.
